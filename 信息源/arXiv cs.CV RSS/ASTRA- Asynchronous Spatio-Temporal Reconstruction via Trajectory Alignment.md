Abstract: Dynamic 3D scene reconstruction has achieved remarkable success under the assumption of strictly synchronized multi-camera inputs. However, in real-world scenarios, temporal asynchrony among capturing devices remains a critical challenge, leading to severe motion blur and geometric artifacts. Existing asynchronous reconstruction methods typically estimate temporal offsets through photometric supervision, but appearance matching provides weak temporal cues under large offsets and complex motions. We attribute this limitation to two major bottlenecks: texture-induced collapse, where low-texture regions provide nearly vanishing alignment signals, and deformation-induced coupling, where temporal errors are absorbed into distorted geometry or motion rather than being explicitly corrected. To address these issues, we propose ASTRA (Asynchronous Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction via Trajectory Alignment), a framework that introduces 2D motion trajectories as explicit, texture-agnostic supervision for asynchronous dynamic reconstruction. Instead of synchronizing cameras solely through rendered color residuals, ASTRA jointly optimizes temporal offsets and dynamic 3D representations by aligning the projected motion of reconstructed 3D points with observed 2D trajectories, while using dynamic and certainty masking to suppress unreliable trajectory constraints. Extensive experiments on different dynamic Gaussian Splatting backbones show that ASTRA preserves high-frequency spatial details and sustains strong robustness even under severe asynchrony with up to 25-frame offsets, achieving approximately 1.4 dB PSNR improvement, reducing temporal-offset MAE by 54.0\%, and nearly quadrupling the synchronization success rate.
